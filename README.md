Weather API Demo Application

Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery in concert with the OpenWeatherMap API, I give you:

The Weather Dashboard!

It allows you to search cities by name to find out:
1. The current weather there.
2. The current tempreture.
3. The humidity.
4. The wind speed.
5. The UV index.
6. And the next 5 day forcast.

It also uses local storage to keep previously searched cities visible under the search bar.
