## Weather API Demo Application:

This simple weather app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to collect the current weather for any city you search. NOTE: This assumes that the city is monitered by the API to begin with. Once a city is searched it will display the current and 5 day forcasts for that city.

## Breakdown:

1. On page load, you will see a search box.
2. Simply type in the name of a city you would like to get the current forcast for.
3. It will also display the next 5 day forcast for that city.
4. All searches are saved below the search box for quick reference.
